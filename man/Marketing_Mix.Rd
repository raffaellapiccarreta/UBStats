\description{
This dataframe contains data on marketing campaigns conducted across
municipalities in Italy. It provides information on marketing investments in
each area, including spending on online paid search (paying to have a website
or ad appear at the top of a search engine results page), online display
(paying for visual ads on websites, apps, or social media platforms) and
retargeting (targeting users who previously interacted with the brand
online -- e.g. visiting a website, using an app, or engaging with content --
but did not complete a desired action, like making a purchase).
These investments affect key digital performance indicators (KPIs), such as
customer interactions and paid or organic website sessions (visits resulting
from sponsored or non-paid links), which represent intermediate outcomes that
may influence sales and new customer acquisition -- the campaignâ€™s key final
targets. The dataframe also includes information about two types of local
promotions possibly running in each municipality. All variables in the
dataframe --investments, KPIs and outcomes -- are adjusted to account for
structural differences between municipalities.
