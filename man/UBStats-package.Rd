\title{UBStats: a package for teaching and learning introductory statistics}
\description{
The \pkg{UBStats} package has been developed to be support
instructors and students involved in basic statistics courses
at Bocconi University (Milan, Italy). It contains a limited
number of functions, with very similar and coherent syntax,
to easily perform descriptive and inferential statistical analyses.

The main functions included in the package are:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{distr.table.x}()} and \code{\link{distr.plot.x}()} to
tabulate and plot the distribution of a single variable of any type
\item \code{\link{distr.table.xy}()} and \code{\link{distr.plot.xy}()}
to tabulate and plot the joint and conditional distributions for
two variables and to build scatterplots
\item \code{\link{distr.summary.x}()} and \code{\link{summaries.plot.x}()}
to calculate summaries of univariate distributions and/or conditional
summaries and to plot conditional location measures (means, medians
or quantiles)
\item \code{\link{CI.mean}()} and \code{\link{TEST.mean}()} to build
confidence intervals and to test hypotheses on the mean
\item \code{\link{CI.prop}()} and \code{\link{TEST.prop}()} to build
confidence intervals and to test hypotheses on the proportion
\item \code{\link{CI.diffmean}()} and \code{\link{TEST.diffmean}()} to
build confidence intervals and to test hypotheses on the difference
between means
\item \code{\link{CI.diffprop}()} and \code{\link{TEST.diffprop}()} to
build confidence intervals and to test hypotheses on the difference
between proportions
\item \code{\link{TEST.diffvar}()} to test hypotheses on the equality of
two variances
}
}
\details{
The package has some distinctive features making it a convenient support
to students, attending courses on statistics using RStudio, approaching
the software for the first time.

Descriptive statistical analyses can be performed for any type of variables,
with easy and intuitive procedures to tabulate also numerical variables
classified into intervals and/or variables measured in intervals. Collections
of univariate summary statistics can be easily obtained, also for factors.
Univariate and bivariate distributions can be graphically displayed using two
functions only, with a quite rich set of (basic) options.

Inferential statistical analyses can be easily performed based on a reduced
set of functions with very similar syntax.

A peculiar characteristic of the package is that in the case of errors the
procedure is not immediately interrupted. The functions collect all the
possible warnings and error and print a list of all the encountered problems
before the possible interruption due to unmanageable errors. This makes the
package very convenient for students who approach the study of statistics
using RStudio for the first time.
