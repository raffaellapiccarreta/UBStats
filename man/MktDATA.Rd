\title{List of binary dissimilarity matrices among 15 MktDATA terms.}
\format{
{
A \code{\link{UBStats_data}} object whose \code{diss} element is a list of 85
binary dissimilarity matrices. Each matrix is defined as a \code{dist}
object measuring whether each pair of the 15 MktDATA terms is judged as
similar (1) or not (0).

The \code{dist} objects have rows and columns that are named as follows:
\describe{
\item{GrF}{grandfather}
\item{GrM}{grandmother}
\item{GrD}{granddaughter}
\item{GrS}{grandson}
\item{Bro}{brother}
\item{Sis}{sister}
\item{Fat}{father}
\item{Mot}{mother}
\item{Dau}{daughter}
\item{Son}{son}
\item{Nep}{nephew}
\item{Nie}{niece}
\item{Cou}{cousin}
\item{Aun}{aunt}
\item{Unc}{uncle}
}
}

\usage{
data(MktDATA)

\description{
{
Rosenberg and Kim (1975) designed an experiment to analyze the perceived
similarities of 15 MktDATA terms.

Here, we consider the data relative to 85 females made available in
Rosenberg (1982). Each subject was asked to group the MktDATA terms
according to the perceived similarity. Thus, \emph{S} = 85 binary
dissimilarity matrices are available whose elements (0 or 1) indicate
whether or not two MktDATA terms were grouped together by each individual.
